# Final Project for BF528: Applications in Translational Bioinformatics with Dr. Adam Labadorf (Spring 2021)

Analysis of pancreatic single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to determine differential gene expression, which was then used in conjuction with known marker genes to identify pancreatic cell subtypes.

Data from: Baron, Maayan, Adrian Veres, Samuel L. Wolock, Aubrey L. Faust, Renaud Gaujoux, Amedeo Vetere, Jennifer Hyoje Ryu, et al. 2016. “A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-Cell Population Structure.” Cell Systems 3 (4): 346–60.e4.
